                    functions remain obscure. When expressed in yeast, alpha-synuclein associated

	abstract = {Incidence studies of Parkinson's disease (PD) are important for both health-care planning and epidemiological research. This report reviews the methods and results of previous incidence studies of PD and makes recommendations for future studies. Original articles that described the incidence of PD were located using several strategies. The methods were summarised, and the results of studies with similar methodologies were compared on a standardised population. Twenty-five incidence studies were included. Each used different methods to identify incident patients, although most screened both primary care and hospital records. Only eight studies were prospective, and only two of these had any follow-up. The diagnostic criteria for PD varied (11 studies used two or more cardinal motor features, four used the UK Brain Bank criteria), as did the exclusion criteria and the definition of an incident case. In 16 studies, attempts were made to confirm the diagnosis by examination of patients by a specialist as part of the study. None of the studies used identical methods, but five were sufficiently similar to merit comparison. Four of these gave a similar incidence (16-19/100000/year), but one from Italy had a much lower incidence (8.4/100000), the reason for which was unclear. Five studies found significantly greater incidence in men. This review highlights the difficulties in performing good quality incidence studies of PD. Further incidence studies using standardised methods are required. A set of minimal scientific criteria has been devised to improve the quality and consistency of future studies.},

METHODS: Two hundred thirty-seven patients with a symptom onset between 1974 and 1984 were followed until the date of December 31, 2012 or death, representing a follow-up period of up to 38 years. Overall and cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, and predictors for survival at disease onset were estimated.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Two hundred thirty patients had died by December 31, 2012; a total of 3,489 person-years were available for observation. The SMR at 38 years of follow-up was 2.02 (1.76-2.29). Employing Cox's proportional hazard modeling, male sex, gait disorder, absence of classical rest tremor, and absence of asymmetry predicted poor survival in this cohort. Increased cause-specific SMRs were found for pneumonia and cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases.},

The prevalence per 100,000 population was 117.9 (72.8 in males and 159.1 in females), and the incidence during the period 1989 through 1992 was 15.0 per 100,000 population per year. The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence per 100,000 population was 99.5 in 1992 and 103.9 in 1980, as calculated using the 1990 Japanese population as the standard. The age-adjusted prevalence in the population under 60 years of age and the incidence in those under 55 years of age in 1992 were lower than in those under 55 in 1980. These results revealed that changes in the age structure of the population were the main contributors to the increased incidence of PD.},

Pathological examination cannot classify the clinical syndrome with certainty; therefore, the neuropathological diagnosis is, at best, a probability statement. The neuropathological diagnosis of parkinsonism has become increasingly based on fundamental molecular underpinnings, with recognition that the genetics of parkinsonism is heterogeneous and includes disorders that are associated with and without Lewy bodies. The advent of alpha-synuclein immunohistochemistry has substantially improved the ability to identify Lewy pathology, particularly cortical Lewy bodies and smaller aggregates within processes and the neuropil. In this Review we discuss the diagnostic criteria for the neuropathological assessment of PD. These criteria are provisional and need to be validated through an iterative process that could help with their refinement. Additionally, we suggest future directions for neuropathology research on PD.},

	abstract = {Synucleins are a family of small, presynaptic neuronal proteins comprised of a-, b-, g-synucleins and synoretin, of which only a-synuclein aggregates have been associated with several neurological diseases. The normal neuronal function of synucleins are presently unknown, but several activities such as lipid vesicle binding, inhibition of phospholipase D2 and protein kinase C, dopamine uptake and as a chaperone have been ascribed to a-synuclein. The role of synuclein in the etiology of neuropathology has developed from several observations. Pathologically, synuclein was identiﬁed as the major component of Lewy bodies (LBs), the hallmark inclusions of Parkinson’s disease (PD), and a fragment thereof was isolated from amyloid plaques of a different neurological disease, Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Biochemically, recombinant a-synuclein was shown to be able to form ﬁbrils which recapitulated the ultrastructural features of a-synuclein isolated from patients with dementia with LBs (DLB), PD and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Additionally, the identiﬁcation of mutations within the synuclein gene, albeit in rare cases of familial PD, demonstrated an unequivocal link between synuclein pathology and neurodegenerative disease. The common involvement of a-synuclein in a spectrum of diseases such as PD, DLB, MSA and the LB variant of AD has led to the classiﬁcation of these diseases under the umbrella term of synucleinopathies. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Upon expression of this human protein in the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the events leading to aggregation and the molecular mechanisms that result in cellular toxicity are faithfully reproduced. More recently, a similar model to study the presumed pathobiology of the α-synuclein interaction partner synphilin-1 has been established.

In this context, they have proven invaluable in the study of complex mechanisms such as those involved in a variety of human disorders. Here, we first provide a brief historical perspective on the emergence of yeast as an experimental model and on how the field evolved to exploit the potential of the model for tackling the intricacies of various human diseases. In particular, we focus on existing yeast models of the molecular underpinnings of Parkinson’s disease (PD), focusing primarily on the central role of protein quality control systems. Finally, we compile and discuss the major discoveries derived from these studies, highlighting their far-reaching impact on the elucidation of PD-associated mechanisms as well as in the identification of candidate therapeutic targets and compounds with therapeutic potential.},

These include Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. A growing body of knowledge on the biology of aSyn is emerging and enabling novel hypotheses to be tested. In particular, the hypothesis that aSyn is secreted from neurons, thus contributing to the spreading of pathology not only in the brain but also in other organs, is gaining momentum. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism(s) of secretion, as well as the consequences of extracellular aSyn species for neighboring cells are still unclear. Here, we review the current literature and integrate existing data in order to propose possible mechanisms of secretion, cell dysfunction, and death. Ultimately, the complete understanding of these processes might open novel avenues for the development of new therapeutic strategies.},

The earliest defect following αSyn expression in yeast was a block in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–to–Golgi vesicular trafficking. In a genomewide screen, the largest class of toxicity modifiers were proteins functioning at this same step, including the Rab guanosine triphosphatase Ypt1p, which associated with cytoplasmic αSyn inclusions. Elevated expression of Rab1, the mammalian YPT1 homolog, protected against αSyn-induced dopaminergic neuron loss in animal models of PD.

Skp1 binds a motif called the F-box and in turn F-box proteins appear to recruit specific substrates for ubiquitination. We find that Skp1 interacts with Cdc53 in vivo, and that Skp1 bridges Cdc53 to three different F-box proteins, Cdc4, Met30, and Grr1. Cdc53 contains independent binding sites for Cdc34 and Skp1 suggesting it functions as a scaffold protein within an E2/E3 core complex. F-box proteins show remarkable functional specificity in vivo: Cdc4 is specific for degradation of Sic1, Grr1 is specific for degradation of the G1 cyclin Cln2, and Met30 is specific for repression of methionine biosynthesis genes. In contrast, the Cdc34–Cdc53–Skp1 E2/E3 core complex is required for all three functions. Combinatorial control of SCF complexes may provide a basis for the regulation of diverse cellular processes.},

We isolated Cdc53 as a Cln2-associated protein and show that Cdc53 is required for Cln2 instability and ubiquitination in vivo. The Cln2–Cdc53 interaction, Cln2 ubiquitination, and Cln2 instability all depend on phosphorylation of Cln2. Cdc53 also binds the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Cdc34.

This analysis revealed altered expression for several gene families, including genes involved in the regulation of cell wall organization and biosynthesis. This led us to uncover a role for the Cdc34/SCF complex in the regulation of cell wall integrity. In support of this, cdc53-1 and cdc34-2 mutants exhibit phenotypes characteristic of cell wall integrity mutants, such as SDS sensitivity and temperature-sensitive suppression by osmotic stabilizers. Examination of these mutants revealed defects in their induction of Slt2 phosphorylation, indicating defects in Pkc1-Slt2 MAPK signaling. Consistent with this, synthetic genetic interactions were observed between the genes encoding the Cdc34/SCF complex and key components of the Pck1-Slt2 MAPK pathway. Further analysis revealed that Cdc34/SCF mutants have reduced levels of active Rho1, suggesting that these defects stem from the deregulated activity of the Rho1 GTPase. Altering the activity of Rho1 via manipulation of the Rho1-GAPs LRG1 or SAC7 affected Cdc34/SCF mutant growth. Strikingly, however, deletion of LRG1 rescued the growth defects associated with Cdc34/SCF mutants, whereas deletion of SAC7 enhanced these defects. Given the differential roles that these GAPs play in the regulation of Rho1, these observations indicate the importance of coordinating Cdc34/SCF activity with specific Rho1 functions.},

	abstract = {Critically impaired protein degradation is discussed to contribute to neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s, Huntington’s, Alzheimer’s, and motor neuron diseases. Misfolded, aggregated, or surplus proteins are efficiently degraded via distinct protein degradation pathways, including the ubiquitin-proteasome system, autophagy, and vesicular trafficking. These pathways are regulated by covalent modification of target proteins with the small protein ubiquitin and are evolutionary highly conserved from humans to yeast. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an established model for deciphering mechanisms of protein degradation, and for the elucidation of pathways underlying programmed cell death. The expression of human neurotoxic proteins triggers cell death in yeast, with neurotoxic protein-specific differences. Therefore, yeast cell death models are suitable for analyzing the role of protein degradation pathways in modulating cell death upon expression of disease-causing proteins. This review summarizes which protein degradation pathways are affected in these yeast models, and how they are involved in the execution of cell death. I will discuss to which extent this mimics the situation in other neurotoxic models, and how this may contribute to a better understanding of human disorders.},

Moreover, the normal cellular function of α-synuclein remains debated. In this perspective, we review the structural characteristics of α-synuclein, its developmental expression pattern, its cellular and subcellular localization, and its function in neurons. We also discuss recent progress on secretion of α-synuclein, which may contribute to its interneuronal spread in a prion-like fashion, and describe the neurotoxic effects of α-synuclein that are thought to be responsible for its role in neurodegeneration.},

Confocal laser microscopy analysis revealed that anti-NACP immunostaining was colocalized with synaptophysin-immunoreactive presynaptic terminals. Ultrastructural analysis showed that NACP immunoreactivity was associated with synaptic vesicles. NACP sequence showed 95\% identity with that of rat synuclein 1, a synapUc/nuclear protein previously identified in rat brain, and good homology with Torpedo synuclein from the electric organ synapse and bovine phosphoneuroprotein 14 (PNP-14), a brain-specific protein present in synapses.

	abstract = {Two widely expressed mammalian phosphatidylcholine (PC)-specific phospholipases D (PLD), PLD1 and PLD2, have been identified. Recombinantly expressed PLD2 has high basal activity and is insensitive to GTP-binding protein activators of PLD1 [Colley, W. C., et al. (1997) Curr. Biol. 7, 191201]. To investigate the regulation of PLD2 we isolated PLD2, from mouse brain by immunoaffinity chromatography. The native and recombinant proteins have indistinguishable properties: PLD2 is potently activated by phosphoinositides with a vicinal 4,5-phosphate pair but is not stimulated by guanosine 5′O-(3-thio triphosphate)-activated ADP-ribosylation factor-1, Rho family GTP-binding proteins, or protein kinases C-R, or -β1. We used recombinant PLD2 in a reconstitution assay to search for regulators in cell and tissue extracts. Bovine brain contains a heat-stable protein factor that inhibits PLD2 activity in vitro. This factor was purified to homogeneity and identified as a mixture of R- and β-synucleins by microsequencing and Western blotting. Recombinantly expressed R- and β-synucleins inhibit PLD2 activity in vitro (K0.5 10 nM). Inhibition is not overcome by the protein or lipid activators of PLD1. Synucleins have been implicated in Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. Our findings suggest that inhibition of PLD2 may be a function of synucleins. Modulation of PLD2 activity by synucleins may play a role in some aspects of the pathophysiologies that characterize these neurodegenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {Background: Activation of phospholipase D (PLD) is an important but poorly understood component of receptor-mediated signal transduction responses and regulated secretion. We recently reported the cloning of the human gene encoding PLD1; this enzyme has low basal activity and is activated by protein kinase C and the small GTP-binding proteins, ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), Rho, Rac and Cdc42. Biochemical and cell biological studies suggest, however, that additional and distinct PLD activities exist in cells, so a search was carried out for novel mammalian genes related to PLD1.
Results: We have cloned the gene for a second PLD family member and characterized the protein product, which appears to be regulated differently from PLD1: PLD2 is constitutively active and may be modulated in vivo by inhibition. Unexpectedly, PLD2 localizes primarily to the plasma membrane, in contrast to PLD1 which localizes solely to peri-nuclear regions (the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and late endosomes), where PLD activity has been shown to promote ARF-mediated coated-vesicle formation. PLD2 provokes cortical reorganization and undergoes redistribution in serum-stimulated cells, suggesting that it may have a role in signal-induced cytoskeletal regulation and/or endocytosis.
Conclusions: PLD2 is a newly identified mammalian PLD isoform with novel regulatory properties. Our findings suggest that regulated secretion and morphological reorganization, the two most frequently proposed biological roles for PLD, are likely to be effected separately by PLD1 and PLD2.},

Nigrostriatal terminals of α-Syn-/- mice display a standard pattern of dopamine (DA) discharge and reuptake in response to simple electrical stimulation. However, they exhibit an increased release with paired stimuli that can be mimicked by elevated Ca2+. Concurrent with the altered DA release, α-Syn-/-

However, the normal functions of the synucleins are still unknown. For this reason, we characterized α-, β-, and γ-synuclein expression in primary hippocampal neuronal cultures and showed that the onset of α- and β-synuclein expression was delayed after synaptic development, suggesting that these synucleins may not be essential for synapse formation. In mature cultured primary neurons, α- and β-synuclein colocalized almost exclusively with synaptophysin in the presynaptic terminal, whereas little γ-synuclein was expressed at all. To assess the function of α-synuclein, we suppressed expression of this protein with antisense oligonucleotide technology. Morphometric ultrastructural analysis of the α-synuclein antisense oligonucleotide-treated cultures revealed a significant reduction in the distal pool of synaptic vesicles. These data suggest that one function of α-synuclein may be to regulate the size of distinct pools of synaptic vesicles in mature neurons.},

	abstract = {A neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD) is a widespread amyloid deposition. We analyzed the entire amino acid sequences in an amyloid preparation and found, in addition to the major beta/A4-protein (A beta) fragment, two unknown peptides. We raised antibodies against synthetic peptides using subsequences of these peptides. These antibodies immunostained amyloid in neuritic and diffuse plaques as well as vascular amyloid. Electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that the immunostaining was localized on amyloid fibrils. We have isolated an apparently full-length cDNA encoding a 140-amino-acid protein within which two previously unreported amyloid sequences are encoded in tandem in the most hydrophobic domain. We tentatively named this 35-amino acid peptide NAC (non-A beta component of AD amyloid) and its precursor NACP. NAC is the second component, after A beta, identified chemically in the purified AD amyloid preparation. Secondary structure predictions indicate that the NAC peptide sequence has a strong tendency to form beta-structures consistent with its association with amyloid. NACP is detected as a M(r) 19,000 protein in the cytosolic fraction of brain homogenates and comigrates on immunoblots with NACP synthesized in Escherichia coli from NACP cDNA. NACP mRNA is expressed principally in brain but is also expressed in low concentrations in all tissues examined except in liver, suggesting its ubiquitous and brain-specific functions. The availability of the cDNA encoding full-length NACP should help to elucidate the mechanisms of amyloidosis in AD.},

The mechanism by which this presynaptic protein is involved in the two most common neurodegenerative disorders, AD and PD, remains unclear. Remarkably, another member of this gene family, γ-synuclein, has been shown to be overexpressed in breast carcinomas and may also be overexpressed in ovarian cancer. The possible involvement of the synuclein proteins in the etiology of common human diseases has raised exciting questions and is the subject of intense investigation. Details of the properties of any member of the synuclein family may provide useful information for understanding the characteristics and function of other family members.

(1990) J. Neurochem. 55, 2031–2038]. In the present study, we determined the primary structure of this protein, found that it is phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo, and designated it phosphoneuroprotein 14 (PNP 14). The protein is a single polypeptide with 134 amino acid residues (molecular mass = 14122Da), and it contains a hydrophobic region at the center of the molecule. The carboxy-terminal region has all seven proline residues, and is rich in glutamic acid, which contribute to the acidic property of the protein. The amino-terminal region possesses four unique repetitive motifs, Glu(Ser)-Lys-Thr-Lys-Glu(Gln)-Gly(Gln)-Val(Ala). When a cytosolic fraction prepared from rat cerebral cortex was incubated with [γ−32P]ATP, 32P was incorporated into PNP 14. Phosphorylated PNP 14 was immuno-precipitated from rat brain synaptosomes labeled metabolically with [32P]orthophosphate. Injection of [32P]orthophosphate into the third ventricle of rat brain resulted in incorporation of radioactive phosphate into PNP 14. We have also found that Ca2+, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylates serine residue(s) of PNP 14 in vitro. The results suggest that PNP 14 may be important to neuronal cells, but not to glial cells, and that its physiological functions may be controlled by the phosphorylation reaction.},

The α-synuclein sequence is largely composed of degenerate 11-residue repeats reminiscent of the amphipathic α-helical domains of the exchangeable apolipoproteins. We hypothesized that α-synuclein should associate with phospholipid bilayers and that this lipid association should stabilize an α-helical secondary structure in the protein. We report that α-synuclein binds to small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles containing acidic phospholipids, but not to vesicles with a net neutral charge. We further show that the protein associates preferentially with vesicles of smaller diameter (20–25 nm) as opposed to larger (∼125 nm) vesicles. Lipid binding is accompanied by an increase in α-helicity from 3\% to approximately 80\%. These observations are consistent with a role in vesicle function at the presynaptic terminal.},

The rest of the molecule remains disordered in the bulk of the solution. The conformation of the N-terminal portion of the molecule in lipids was described as an extended helix [Ramakrishnan, M., Jensen, P. H., and Marsh, D.

We characterized the topology of the different regions of R-synuclein relative to the surface of SDS micelles using spin probe-induced broadening of NMR signals, 15N relaxation measurements, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Our results support the presence of two N-terminal helices, positioned on the surface of the micelle and separated by a flexible stretch. The region of residues 61-95 of the protein also adopts a helical conformation, but it is partially embedded in the micelle. These results could shed some light on the role of the membrane on the aggregation process of R-synuclein.},

 the pathogenesis of α-synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson disease. We
 found that the A30P mutant accelerates nucleation-dependent fibrillization of
 wild type (WT) α-synuclein. Electron microscopy observation and
 ultracentrifugation experiments revealed that shedding of fragments occurs
 from A30P fibrils and that these fragments accelerate fibrillization by
 serving as seeds. Immunochemical analysis using epitope-specific antibodies
 and biochemical analyses of protease-resistant cores demonstrated that A30P
 fibrils have a distinct conformation. Interestingly, WT fibrils formed with
 A30P seeds exhibited the same character as A30P fibrils, as did A30P fibrils
 formed with WT seeds, indicating that the A30P mutation affects the
 conformation and fibrillization of both WT and A30P. These effects of A30P
 mutation may explain the apparent conflict between the association of A30P
 with Parkinson disease and the slow fibrillization of A30P itself and
 therefore provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of
 α-synucleinopathies.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease belongs to a group of currently incurable neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the misfolding and accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates that are commonly known as synucleinopathies. Clinically, synucleinopathies are heterogeneous, reflecting the somewhat selective neuronal vulnerability characteristic of each disease. The precise molecular underpinnings of synucleinopathies remain unclear, but the process of aggregation of alpha-synuclein appears as a central event. However, there is still no consensus with respect to the toxic forms of alpha-synuclein, hampering our ability to use the protein as a target for therapeutic intervention. To decipher the molecular bases of synucleinopathies, it is essential to understand the complex triangle formed between the structure, function and toxicity of alpha-synuclein. Recently, important steps have been undertaken to elucidate the role of the protein in both physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we provide an overview of recent findings in the field of alpha-synuclein research, and put forward a new perspective over paradigms that persist in the field. Establishing whether alpha-synuclein has a causative role in all synucleinopathies will enable the identification of targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for this devastating group of disorders. Alpha-synuclein is the speculated cornerstone of several neurodegenerative disorders known as Synucleinopathies. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying the pathogenic effects of this protein remain unknown. Here, we review the recent findings in the three corners of alpha-synuclein biology – structure, function and toxicity – and discuss the enigmatic roads that have accompanied alpha-synuclein from the beginning. This article is part of a special issue on Parkinson disease.},

These include the helical membrane-bound form, a partially-folded state that is a key intermediate in aggregation and ﬁbrillation, various oligomeric species, and ﬁbrillar and amorphous aggregates. The molecular basis of PD appears to be tightly coupled to the aggregation of α-synuclein and the factors that affect its conformation.

These are ubiquitinated cytoplasmic inclusions containing α-synuclein, an abundant protein normally associated with presynaptic terminals. Point mutations in the α-synuclein gene (A30P and A53T), as well as triplication of the wild-type (WT) locus, have been linked to autosomal dominant Parkinson's. How these alterations might contribute to disease progression is unclear. Using the genetically tractable yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system, we find that both the WT and the A53T isoforms of α-synuclein initially localize to the plasma membrane, to which they are delivered via the classical secretory pathway. In contrast, the A30P mutant protein disperses within the cytoplasm and does not associate with the plasma membrane, and its intracellular distribution is unaffected by mutations in the secretory pathway. When their expression is elevated, WT and A53T, but not A30P, are toxic to cells. At moderate levels of expression, WT and A53T induce the cellular stress (heat-shock) response and are toxic to cells bearing mutations in the 20S proteasome. Our results reveal a link between plasma membrane targeting of α-synuclein and its toxicity in yeast and suggest a role for the quality control (QC) system in the cell's effort to deal with this natively unfolded protein.},

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that results from the selective loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Misfolding and aggregation of the protein α-synuclein, oxidative damage, and proteasomal impairment are all hypotheses for the molecular cause of this selective neurotoxicity. Here, we describe a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model to evaluate the misfolding, aggregation, and toxicity-inducing ability of wild-type α-synuclein and three mutants (A30P, A53T, and A30P/A53T), and we compare regulation of these properties by dysfunctional proteasomes and by oxidative stress. We found prominent localization of wild-type and A53T α-synuclein near the plasma membrane, supporting known in vitro lipid-binding ability. In contrast, A30P was mostly cytoplasmic, whereas A30P/A53T displayed both types of fluorescence. Surprisingly, α-synuclein was not toxic to several yeast strains tested. When yeast mutants for the proteasomal barrel (doa3-1) were evaluated, delayed α-synuclein synthesis and membrane association were observed; yeast mutant for the proteasomal cap (sen3-1) exhibited increased accumulation and aggregation of α-synuclein. Both sen3-1and doa3-1 mutants exhibited synthetic lethality with α-synuclein. When yeasts were challenged with an oxidant (hydrogen peroxide), α-synuclein was extremely lethal to cells that lacked manganese superoxide dismutase Mn-SOD (sod2∆) but not to cells that lacked copper, zinc superoxide dismutase Cu,Zn-SOD (sod1∆). Despite the toxicity, sod2∆ cells never displayed intracellular aggregates of α-synuclein. We suggest that the toxic α-synuclein species in yeast are smaller than the visible aggregates, and toxicity might involve α-synuclein membrane association. Thus, yeasts have emerged effective organisms for characterizing factors and mechanisms that regulate α-synuclein toxicity.},

By applying PRISM to a yeast model of Parkinson’s disease (PD), we identiﬁed guide RNAs (gRNAs) that modulate transcriptional networks and protect cells from alpha-synuclein (aSyn) toxicity. One gRNA identiﬁed in this screen outperformed the most protective suppressors of aSyn toxicity reported previously, highlighting PRISM’s ability to identify modulators of important phenotypes. Gene expression proﬁling revealed genes differentially modulated by this strong protective gRNA that rescued yeast from aSyn toxicity when overexpressed. Human homologs of topranked hits protected against aSyn-induced cell death in a human neuronal PD model.

Elimination of Yca1 caspase activity augmented both cytotoxicity and inclusion body formation, suggesting the involvement of apoptotic pathway components in toxic α-synuclein amyloidogenesis. Deletion of hydrophobic amino acids at positions 66–74 in α-synuclein reduced its cytotoxicity but, remarkably, did not lower the levels of insoluble α-synuclein, indicating that noxious α-synuclein species are different from insoluble aggregates. A compound screen aimed at finding molecules with therapeutic potential identified flavonoids with strong activity to restrain α-synuclein toxicity. Subsequent structure–activity analysis elucidated that these acted by virtue of anti-oxidant and metal-chelating activities.

Two recently identified point mutations in α-synuclein are the only known genetic causes of PD. α-Synuclein fibrils similar to the Lewy body filaments can be formedin vitro, and we have shown recently that both PD-linked mutations accelerate their formation. This study addresses the mechanism of α-synuclein aggregation: we show that (i) it is a nucleation-dependent process that can be seeded by aggregated α-synuclein functioning as nuclei, (ii) this fibril growth follows first-order kinetics with respect to α-synuclein concentration, and (iii) mutant α-synuclein can seed the aggregation of wild type α-synuclein, which leads us to predict that the Lewy bodies of familial PD patients with α-synuclein mutations will contain both, the mutant and the wild type protein. Finally (iv), we show that wild type and mutant forms of α-synuclein do not differ in their critical concentrations. These results suggest that differences in aggregation kinetics of α-synucleins cannot be explained by differences in solubility but are due to different nucleation rates. Consequently, α-synuclein nucleation may be the rate-limiting step for the formation of Lewy body α-synuclein fibrils in Parkinson’s disease.},

Intriguingly, α-synuclein is characterized by a remarkable conformational plasticity, adopting a series of different conformations depending on the environment. For example, this protein may either stay substantially unfolded, or adopt an amyloidogenic partially folded conformation, or fold into α-helical or β-structural species, both monomeric and oligomeric. Furthermore, it might form several morphologically different types of aggregates, including oligomers (spheres or doughnuts), amorphous aggregates, and or amyloid-like fibrils. The peculiarities of this astonishing conformational behavior are analyzed to shed light on structural plasticity of this protein-chameleon.},

Using paramagnetic relaxation enhancement and NMR dipolar couplings, we show that monomeric αS assumes conformations that are stabilized by long-range interactions and act to inhibit oligomerization and aggregation. The autoinhibitory conformations fluctuate in the range of nanoseconds to micro-seconds corresponding to the time scale of secondary structure formation during folding. Polyamine binding and/or temperature increase, conditions that induce aggregation in vitro, release this inherent tertiary structure, leading to a completely unfolded conformation that associates readily. Stabilization of the native, autoinhibitory structure of αS constitutes a potential strategy for reducing or inhibiting oligomerization and aggregation in Parkinson's disease.},

Indeed, the accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein now defines multiple forms of neural degeneration. Like many of the proteins that accumulate in other neurodegenerative disorders, however, the normal function of synuclein remains poorly understood. α-Synuclein localizes specifically to the nerve terminal and inhibits neurotransmitter release when over-expressed, but the knockout has a modest effect on synaptic transmission, suggesting alternative presynaptic roles. Natively unstructured, synuclein adopts a helical conformation on membrane binding and recent work suggests a role in membrane remodeling. In neural degeneration, synuclein misfolds and aggregates as a β-sheet. Multiple observations now suggest propagation of the misfolded protein as a prion, providing a mechanism for the spread of degeneration through the neuraxis. However, the factors that trigger the original misfolding remain unknown.},

	abstract = {Synelfin is a presynaptic protein of unknown function that is differentially regulated in the avian song control circuit during the critical period for song learning; in humans, it gives rise to an amyloidogenic peptide found in senile plaques of Alzheimer’s disease. To gain insight into the potential involvement of synelfin in synapse development, we investigated its expression in neurons cultured from the embryonic rat hippocampus. These neurons express a variety of defined synaptic proteins, and form numerous synaptic connections after several days in culture. Synapsin I, a synaptic vesicle-associated protein, was detected within one day after the neurons were put in culture, but significant immunoreactivity for synelfin was not detected until ; 5 days in vitro ŽDIV.. By 3 DIV, synapsin-positive puncta Žpreviously shown to correspond to presynaptic specializations. were detected surrounding the soma and proximal dendritic processes, whereas comparable aggregations of synelfin did not appear until several days later. By 14 DIV the punctate concentrations of synelfin and synapsin overlapped completely. Thus synelfin is expressed in these cultured neurons and eventually becomes localized to presynaptic terminals, but it is absent from these specializations when they first form. We conclude that presynaptic terminals can change in molecular composition, and that synelfin is associated with later stages in synaptic development or modulation. q Elsevier Science B.V.

They are characterized by the degeneration of selected populations of nerve cells that develop filamentous inclusions before degeneration. The neuronal inclusions of Alzheimer's disease are made of the microtubule-associated protein tau, in a hyperphosphorylated state. Recent work has shown that the filamentous inclusions of Parkinson's disease are made of the protein alpha-synuclein and that rare, familial forms of Parkinson's disease are caused by missense mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene. Besides Parkinson's disease, the filamentous inclusions of two additional neurodegenerative diseases, namely dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy, have also been found to be made of alpha-synuclein. Abundant filamentous tau inclusions are not limited to Alzheimer's disease. They are the defining neuropathological characteristic of frontotemporal dementias such as Pick's disease, and of progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. The recent discovery of mutations in the tau gene in familial forms of frontotemporal dementia has provided a direct link between tau dysfunction and dementing disease. The new work has established that tauopathies and alpha-synucleinopathies account for most late-onset neurodegenerative diseases in man. The formation of intracellular filamentous inclusions might be the gain of toxic function that leads to the demise of affected brain cells.},

It is genetically linked to Parkinson’s disease (PD) in that missense mutations or multiplication of the gene encoding αSyn cause early-onset familial PD. Furthermore, the neuropathological hallmarks of both sporadic and familial PD, Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, contain insoluble aggregates of αSyn. Several studies have reported evidence that αSyn can inhibit phospholipase D (PLD), which hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to form phosphatidic acid and choline. Although various hypotheses exist regarding the roles of αSyn in health and disease, no other specific biochemical function for this protein has been reported to date. Because PLD inhibition could represent an important function of αSyn, we sought to extend existing reports on this interaction. Using purified proteins, we tested the ability of αSyn to inhibit PLD activity in cell-free assays. We also examined several cell lines and transfection conditions to assess whether αSyn inhibits endogenous or overexpressed PLD in cultured mammalian cells. In yeast, we extended our previous report of an interaction between αSyn and PLD-dependent phenotypes, for which PLD activity is absolutely necessary. Despite testing a range of experimental conditions, including those previously published, we observed no significant inhibition of PLD by αSyn in any of these systems. We propose that the previously reported effects of αSyn on PLD activity could be due to increased endoplasmic reticulum-related stress associated with αSyn overexpression in cells, but are not likely due to a specific and direct interaction between αSyn and PLD.},

Although the function of α-synuclein remains largely unknown, recent studies have demonstrated that this protein can interact with phospholipids. To address the role of α-synuclein in neurodegenerative disease, we have investigated whether it binds phospholipase D (PLD) and affects PLD activity in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells overexpressing wild type α-synuclein or the mutant forms of α-synuclein (A53T, A30P) associated with Parkinson's disease. Tyrosine phosphorylation of α-synuclein appears to play a modulatory role in the inhibition of PLD, because mutation of Tyr125 to Phe slightly increases inhibitory effect of α-synuclein on PLD activity. Treatment with pervanadate or phorbol myristate acetate inhibits PLD more in HEK 293 cells overexpressing α-synuclein than in control cells. Binding of α-synuclein to PLD requires phox and pleckstrin homology domain of PLD and the amphipathic repeat region and non-Aβ component of α-synuclein. Although biologically important, co-transfection studies indicate that the interaction of α-synuclein with PLD does not influence the tendency of α-synuclein to form pathological inclusions. These results suggest that the association of α-synuclein with PLD, and modulation of PLD activity, is biologically important, but PLD does not appear to play an essential role in the pathophysiology of α-synuclein.},

Overexpression of gamma-synuclein in human breast cancer cells leads to an increase in cell motility, resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, and mitotic checkpoint dysfunction. We report in this study that gamma-synuclein is up-regulated by endoplasmic reticulum stress. The up-regulation of gamma-synuclein expression by endoplasmic reticulum stress is mediated, at least in part, by activation transcription factor (ATF) 4. Knockdown of gamma-synuclein sensitized human breast cancer cells to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis by endoplasmic reticulum stress when gamma-synuclein was inhibited was dependent on JNK or caspase activation, with caspase-3 and caspase-7 being involved. Treatment with the JNK or caspase3 and caspase-7 inhibitor partially blocked endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells transfected with or without the siRNA against gamma-synuclein. Taken together, these data suggest that gamma-synuclein may promote cancer progression by suppressing endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis.},

However, conflicting data exist about the normal function of α-synuclein, possibly because α-synuclein is redundant with the very similar β-synuclein. To investigate the functions of synucleins systematically, we have now generated single- and double-knockout (KO) mice that lack α- and/or β-synuclein. We find that deletion of synucleins in mice does not impair basic brain functions or survival. We detected no significant changes in the ultrastructure of synuclein-deficient synapses, in short- or long-term synaptic plasticity, or in the pool size or replenishment of recycling synaptic vesicles. However, protein quantitations revealed that KO of synucleins caused selective changes in two small synaptic signaling proteins, complexins and 14-3-3 proteins. Moreover, we found that dopamine levels in the brains of double-KO but not single-KO mice were decreased by ≈20\%. In contrast, serotonin levels were unchanged, and dopamine uptake and release from isolated nerve terminals were normal. These results show that synucleins are not essential components of the basic machinery for neurotransmitter release but may contribute to the long-term regulation and/or maintenance of presynaptic function.},

They comprise three closely related members, α-, β-, and γ-synuclein. α-Synuclein has been the focus of intense attention since mutations in it were identified as a cause for familial Parkinson's disease. Despite their disease relevance, the normal physiological function of synucleins has remained elusive. To address this, we generated and characterized αβγ-synuclein knockout mice, which lack all members of this protein family. Deletion of synucleins causes alterations in synaptic structure and transmission, age-dependent neuronal dysfunction, as well as diminished survival. Abrogation of synuclein expression decreased excitatory synapse size by ∼30\% both in vivo and in vitro, revealing that synucleins are important determinants of presynaptic terminal size. Young synuclein null mice show improved basic transmission, whereas older mice show a pronounced decrement. The late onset phenotypes in synuclein null mice were not due to a loss of synapses or neurons but rather reflect specific changes in synaptic protein composition and axonal structure. Our results demonstrate that synucleins contribute importantly to the long-term operation of the nervous system and that alterations in their physiological function could contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease.},

Methods: We screened 1,106 patients with parkinsonism (PD ϭ 906, MSA ϭ 200) for SNCA multiplication by multiplex PCR. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was done to confirm the multiplication. [123I]N-␻-Fluoropropyl-2␤-carbomethoxy-3␤-(4-iodophenyl)-tropane ([123I]FP-CIT) SPECT was done in the patients with SNCA multiplication and their family members.
Results: Three patients were identified as having SNCA duplication. One patient had a positive family history, and two patients were sporadic. Each patient had asymptomatic carriers in their families. The familial case had early onset parkinsonism with rapidly progressive course, cognitive impairment, and dysautonomia. Sporadic cases were more typical of PD. [123I]FP-CIT SPECT was abnormal in the patients and normal in the asymptomatic carriers.
Conclusion: SNCA multiplication is present in sporadic Parkinson disease (PD) and needs to be screened. Low penetrance, clinical heterogeneity, and normal dopamine transporter imaging in asymptomatic carriers may suggest the presence of other genetic modifiers or environmental triggers that play a role in the pathogenesis of PD due to SNCA duplication.},

Recent studies have shown that when overexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, α-syn localizes to plasma membranes and forms cytoplasmic accumulations similar to human α-syn inclusions. However, the exact nature, composition, temporal evolution, and underlying mechanisms of yeast α-syn accumulations and their relevance to human synucleinopathies are unknown. Here we provide ultrastructural evidence that α-syn accumulations are not comprised of LB-like fibrils, but are associated with clusters of vesicles. Live-cell imaging showed α-syn initially localized to the plasma membrane and subsequently formed accumulations in association with vesicles. Imaging of truncated and mutant forms of α-syn revealed the molecular determinants and vesicular trafficking pathways underlying this pathological process. Because vesicular clustering is also found in LB-containing neurons of PD brains, α-syn–mediated vesicular accumulation in yeast represents a model system to study specific aspects of neurodegeneration in PD and related synucleinopathies.},

We used a yeast model to screen for deletion mutants with mislocalization and enhanced inclusion formation of α-synuclein. Many of the mutants were affected in functions related to vesicular trafﬁc but especially mutants in endocytosis and vacuolar degradation combined inclusion formation with enhanced α-synuclein-mediated toxicity. The screening also allowed for identiﬁcation of casein kinases responsible for α-synuclein phosphorylation at the plasma membrane as well as transacetylases that modulate the α-synuclein membrane interaction. In addition, α-synuclein was found to associate with lipid rafts, a phenomenon dependent on the ergosterol content. Together, our data suggest that toxicity of α-synuclein in yeast is at least in part associated with endocytosis of the protein, vesicular recycling back to the plasma membrane and vacuolar fusion defects, each contributing to the obstruction of different vesicular trafﬁcking routes.},

We developed a rapid purification method that allowed us to screen 59 synuclein mutants in vitro and discovered two double point mutants that fibrillized slowly relative to wild type, A30P, and A53T α-synucleins. The yeast toxicity of all of these proteins was measured and we found no correlation with fibrillization rate, suggesting that fibrillization is not necessary for synuclein-induced yeast toxicity. We also found that β-synuclein was of intermediate toxicity to yeast and γ-synuclein was non-toxic. Coexpression of Parkinson’s disease related genes DJ-1, parkin, Pink1, UCH-L1, or synphilin, with synuclein, did not affect synuclein toxicity. A second screen, of several thousand library clones in yeast, identified 25 non-toxic α-synuclein sequence variants. Most of these contained a mutation to either proline or glutamic acid that caused a defect in membrane binding. We hypothesize that yeast toxicity is caused by synuclein binding directly to membranes at levels sufficient to non-specifically disrupt homeostasis.},

In addition to its random-coil state, α-syn can adopt an α-helical structure upon lipid membrane binding or a β-sheet structure upon aggregation. We used yeast biology and in vitro biochemistry to detect how sequence changes alter the structural propensity of α-syn. The N-terminus of the protein, which adopts an α-helical conformation upon lipid binding, is essential for membrane binding in yeast, and variants that are more prone to forming an α-helical structure in vitro are generally more toxic to yeast. β-Sheet structure and inclusion formation, on the other hand, appear to be protective, possibly by sequestering the protein from the membrane. Surprisingly, sequential deletion of residues 2 through 11 caused a dramatic drop in α-helical propensity, vesicle binding in vitro, and membrane binding and toxicity in yeast, part of which could be mimicked by mutating aspartic acid at position 2 to alanine. Variants with distinct structural preferences, identified here by a reductionist approach, provide valuable tools for elucidating the nature of toxic forms of α-syn in neurons.},

Introducing the molecular chaperone Hsp70 into the in vivo model by breeding α-synuclein transgenic mice with Hsp70-overexpressing mice led to a significant reduction in both the high molecular weight and detergent-insoluble α-synuclein species.

	abstract = {The pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative disorders arises in association with the misfolding and accumulation of a wide variety of proteins. Much emphasis has been placed on understanding the nature of these protein accumulations, including their composition, the process by which they are formed and the physiological impact they impose at cellular and, ultimately, organismal levels. Alpha-synuclein (ASYN) is the major component of protein inclusions known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which are the typical pathological hallmarks in disorders referred to as synucleinopathies. In addition, mutations or multiplications in the gene encoding for ASYN have also been shown to cause familial cases of PD, the most common synucleinopathy. Although the precise function of ASYN remains unclear, it appears to be involved in a vast array of cellular processes. Here, we review, in depth, a spectrum of cellular and molecular mechanisms that have been implicated in synucleinopathies. Importantly, detailed understanding of the biology/pathobiology of ASYN may enable the development of novel avenues for diagnosis and/or therapeutic intervention in synucleinopathies.},

The patient was clinically diagnosed with atypical Parkinson’s disease (PD) with age of onset at 36 years. In the neuropathological analysis performed at the age of 60 years, highly abundant SNCA pathology was observed throughout the brain and spinal cord showing features of multiple system atrophy and PD. Neuronal and glial (including oligodendroglial) SNCA inclusions and neurites were found to be particularly prominent in the putamen, caudatus, amygdala, temporal and insular cortices, gyrus cinguli, and hippocampus CA2-3 region. These areas as well as the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus showed neuronal loss and gliosis. We also found TDP-43 positive but mostly SNCA negative perinuclear inclusions in the dentate fascia of the hippocampus. The A53E mutation was found in 2 other relatives who had parkinsonism. Our results suggest that the novel SNCA A53E substitution is a causative mutation resulting clinically in parkinsonism and pathologically in severe multiple system atrophy- and PD-type phenotype.},

Methods: Here, we describe a novel missense mutation in exon 4 of SNCA encoding a H50Q substitution in a patient with dopa-responsive Parkinson’s disease with a family history of parkinsonism and dementia.
Results: The variant was not observed in public databases or identiﬁed in unrelated subjects.

The investigation of α-synuclein variants causative of familial forms of Parkinson disease can provide unique insights into the conditions that promote or inhibit aggregate formation. It has been shown recently that a newly identified pathogenic mutation of α-synuclein, H50Q, aggregates faster than the wild-type. We investigate here its aggregation propensity by using a sequence-based prediction algorithm, NMR chemical shift analysis of secondary structure populations in the monomeric state, and determination of thermodynamic stability of the fibrils. Our data show that the H50Q mutation induces only a small increment in polyproline II structure around the site of the mutation and a slight increase in the overall aggregation propensity. We also find, however, that the H50Q mutation strongly stabilizes α-synuclein fibrils by 5.0 ± 1.0 kJ mol−1, thus increasing the supersaturation of monomeric α-synuclein within the cell, and strongly favors its aggregation process. We further show that wild-type α-synuclein can decelerate the aggregation kinetics of the H50Q variant in a dose-dependent manner when coaggregating with it. These last findings suggest that the precise balance of α-synuclein synthesized from the wild-type and mutant alleles may influence the natural history and heterogeneous clinical phenotype of Parkinson disease.},

	abstract = {Three familial variants of the presynaptic protein R-synuclein (RS), A30P, E46K, and A53T, correlate with rare inherited Parkinson’s disease (PD), while wild-type RS is implicated in sporadic PD. The classic manifestation of both familiar and sporadic PD is the formation of fibrillar structures of RS which accumulate as the main component in intraneuronal Lewy bodies. At presynaptic termini, the partitioning of RS between disordered cytosolic and membrane-bound states likely mediates its proposed role in regulation of reserve pools of synaptic vesicles. Previously, we reported on multiple distinct phospholipid binding modes of RS with slow binding kinetics. Here, we report the phospholipid binding properties of the disease variants, viewed by solution NMR in a residue-specific manner. Our results agree qualitatively with previous biophysical studies citing overall decreased lipid affinity for the A30P mutation, comparable affinity for A53T, and an increased level of binding of E46K, relative to wild-type RS. Additionally, our NMR results describe the distribution of lipid-bound states for RS: the population of the SL1 binding mode (residues 3-25 bound as a helix) is augmented by each of the disease variants, relative to wild-type RS. We propose that the SL1 binding mode, which anchors the N-terminus of RS in the lipoprotein complex while the hydrophobic NAC region remains dynamically disordered, is prone to intermolecular interactions which progress toward disease-associated oligomers and fibrils. The elevation of the SL1 binding mode, unchecked by a proportionate population of binding modes incorporating the full N-terminal domain, may well account for the increased toxicity of the A30P, E46K, and A53T disease variants of RS.},

	abstract = {A novel mutation in the α-Synuclein (α-Syn) gene “G51D” was recently identified in two familial cases exhibiting features of Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). In this study, we explored the impact of this novel mutation on the aggregation, cellular and biophysical properties of α-Syn, in an attempt to unravel how this mutant contributes to PD/MSA. Our results show that the G51D mutation significantly attenuates α-Syn aggregation in vitro. Moreover, it disrupts local helix formation in the presence of SDS, decreases binding to lipid vesicles C-terminal to the site of mutation and severely inhibits helical folding in the presence of acidic vesicles. When expressed in yeast, α-SynG51D behaves similarly to α-SynA30P, as both exhibit impaired membrane association, form few inclusions and are non-toxic. In contrast, enhanced secreted and nuclear levels of the G51D mutant were observed in mammalian cells, as well as in primary neurons, where α-SynG51D was enriched in the nuclear compartment, was hyper-phosphorylated at S129 and exacerbated α-Syn-induced mitochondrial fragmentation. Finally, post-mortem human brain tissues of α-SynG51D cases were examined, and revealed only partial colocalization with nuclear membrane markers, probably due to post-mortem tissue delay and fixation. These findings suggest that the PD-linked mutations may cause neurodegeneration via different mechanisms, some of which may be independent of α-Syn aggregation.},

Recently, a third missense mutation (E46K) in a-synuclein was described in an inherited form of dementia with Lewy bodies. Here, we have investigated the functional eﬀects of this novel mutation on phospholipid binding and ﬁlament assembly of a-synuclein. When compared to the wild-type protein, the E46K mutation caused a signiﬁcantly increased ability of a-synuclein to bind to negatively charged liposomes, unlike the previously described mutations. The E46K mutation increased the rate of ﬁlament assembly to the same extent as the A53T mutation. Filaments formed from E46K asynuclein often had a twisted morphology with a cross-over spacing of 43 nm. The observed eﬀects on lipid binding and ﬁlament assembly may explain the pathogenic nature of the E46K mutation in a-synuclein.},

Monogenic forms, caused by a single mutation in a dominantly or recessively inherited gene, are well-established, albeit relatively rare types of PD. They collectively account for about 30\% of the familial and 3\%–5\% of the sporadic cases. In this article, we will summarize the current knowledge and understanding of the molecular genetics of PD. In brief, we will review familial forms of PD, basic genetic principles of inheritance (and their exceptions in PD), followed by current methods for the identification of PD genes and risk factors, and implications for genetic testing., Currently, 28 chromosomal regions are thought to be related to Parkinson’s disease (PD). Six contain genes with mutations that conclusively, albeit rarely, cause monogenic PD.},

Methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) reduces methionine sulfoxide residues and functions as an antioxidant. To monitor the effect of methionine oxidation to α-synuclein on basic cellular processes, α-synucleins were expressed in msrA null mutant and wild-type yeast cells. Protein degradation was inhibited in the α-synuclein-expressing msrA null mutant cells compared to α-synuclein-expressing wild-type cells. Increased inhibition of degradation and elevated accumulations of fibrillated proteins were observed in SynA30P-expressing msrA null mutant cells. Additionally, methionine oxidation inhibited α-synuclein phosphorylation in yeast cells and in vitro by casein kinase 2. Thus, a compromised MsrA function combined with α-synuclein overexpression may promote processes leading to synucleinopathies.},

Although aSyn is phosphorylated at low levels under physiological conditions, it is estimated that ,90\% of aSyn in LBs is phosphorylated at S129 (pS129). Nevertheless, the significance of pS129 in the biology of aSyn and in PD pathogenesis is still controversial. Here, we harnessed the power of budding yeast in order to assess the implications of phosphorylation on aSyn cytotoxicity, aggregation and sub-cellular distribution. We found that aSyn is phosphorylated on S129 by endogenous kinases. Interestingly, phosphorylation reduced aSyn toxicity and the percentage of cells with cytosolic inclusions, in comparison to cells expressing mutant forms of aSyn (S129A or S129G) that mimic the unphosphorylated form of aSyn. Using highresolution 4D imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in live cells, we compared the dynamics of WT and S129A mutant aSyn. While WT aSyn inclusions were very homogeneous, inclusions formed by S129A aSyn were larger and showed FRAP heterogeneity. Upon blockade of aSyn expression, cells were able to clear the inclusions formed by WT aSyn. However, this process was much slower for the inclusions formed by S129A aSyn. Interestingly, whereas the accumulation of WT aSyn led to a marked induction of autophagy, cells expressing the S129A mutant failed to activate this protein quality control pathway. The finding that the phosphorylation state of aSyn on S129 can alter the ability of cells to clear aSyn inclusions provides important insight into the role that this posttranslational modification may have in the pathogenesis of PD and other synucleinopathies, opening novel avenues for investigating the molecular basis of these disorders and for the development of therapeutic strategies.},

	abstract = {α-Synuclein (α-syn) is a small lipid-binding protein involved in vesicle trafficking whose function is poorly characterized. It is of great interest to human biology and medicine because α-syn dysfunction is associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s disease (PD). We previously created a yeast model of α-syn pathobiology, which established vesicle trafficking as a process that is particularly sensitive to α-syn expression. We also uncovered a core group of proteins with diverse activities related to α-syn toxicity that is conserved from yeast to mammalian neurons. Here, we report that a yeast strain expressing a somewhat higher level of α-syn also exhibits strong defects in mitochondrial function. Unlike our previous strain, genetic suppression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi trafficking alone does not suppress α-syn toxicity in this strain. In an effort to identify individual compounds that could simultaneously rescue these apparently disparate pathological effects of α-syn, we screened a library of 115,000 compounds. We identified a class of small molecules that reduced α-syn toxicity at micromolar concentrations in this higher toxicity strain. These compounds reduced the formation of α-syn foci, re-established ER-to-Golgi trafficking and ameliorated α-syn-mediated damage to mitochondria. They also corrected the toxicity of α-syn in nematode neurons and in primary rat neuronal midbrain cultures. Remarkably, the compounds also protected neurons against rotenone-induced toxicity, which has been used to model the mitochondrial defects associated with PD in humans. That single compounds are capable of rescuing the diverse toxicities of α-syn in yeast and neurons suggests that they are acting on deeply rooted biological processes that connect these toxicities and have been conserved for a billion years of eukaryotic evolution. Thus, it seems possible to develop novel therapeutic strategies to simultaneously target the multiple pathological features of PD.},

In yeast α-syn inhibits endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi (ER→Golgi) vesicle trafficking, which is rescued by overexpression of a Rab GTPase that regulates ER→Golgi trafficking. The homologous Rab1 rescues α-syn toxicity in dopaminergic neuronal models of PD. Here we investigate this conserved feature of α-syn pathobiology. In a cell-free system with purified transport factors α-syn inhibited ER→Golgi trafficking in an α-syn dose-dependent manner. Vesicles budded efficiently from the ER, but their docking or fusion to Golgi membranes was inhibited. Thus, the in vivo trafficking problem is due to a direct effect of α-syn on the transport machinery. By ultrastructural analysis the earliest in vivo defect was an accumulation of morphologically undocked vesicles, starting near the plasma membrane and growing into massive intracellular vesicular clusters in a dose-dependent manner. By immunofluorescence/immunoelectron microscopy, these clusters were associated both with α-syn and with diverse vesicle markers, suggesting that α-syn can impair multiple trafficking steps. Other Rabs did not ameliorate α-syn toxicity in yeast, but RAB3A, which is highly expressed in neurons and localized to presynaptic termini, and RAB8A, which is localized to post-Golgi vesicles, suppressed toxicity in neuronal models of PD. Thus, α-syn causes general defects in vesicle trafficking, to which dopaminergic neurons are especially sensitive.},

Here, we show that YPP1 suppresses lethality of A30P, but not of wild-type α-syn or the A53T mutant. The Ypp1 protein, when overexpressed, drives each of the three α-syns into vesicles that bud off the plasma membrane, but only A30P-containing vesicles traffick to and merge with the vacuole, where A30P is proteolytically degraded. We show that Ypp1p binds to A30P but not the other two α-syns; that YPP1 interacts with genes involved in endocytosis/actin dynamics (SLA1, SLA2, and END3), protein sorting (class E vps), and vesicle-vacuole fusion (MON1 and CCZ1) to dispose of A30P; and that YPP1 also participates in pheromone-triggered receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Aggregation is consistently enhanced by dimethyl sulfoxide, which is known to increase the level of phospholipids and membranes in yeast cells. Aggregation of α?synuclein was also triggered by treatment of the yeast cells with ferrous ions, which are known to increase oxidative stress. In addition, data are presented in support of the hypothesis that degradation of α?synuclein occurs via autophagy and proteasomes and that aggregation of α?synuclein disturbs endocytosis. Reminiscent of observations in double?transgenic mice, coexpression of α?synuclein and protein tau in yeast cells is synergistically toxic, as exemplified by inhibition of proliferation. Taken together, the data show that these yeast models recapitulate major aspects of α?synuclein aggregation and cytotoxicity, and offer great potential for defining the underlying mechanisms of toxicity and synergistic actions of α?synuclein and protein tau.},

The protein α-synuclein (αSyn), the principle toxic effector in PD, has been shown to interfere with neuronal Ca2+ fluxes, arguing for an involvement of deregulated Ca2+ homeostasis in this neuronal demise. Here, we identify the Golgi-resident Ca2+/Mn2+ ATPase PMR1 (plasma membrane-related Ca2+-ATPase 1) as a phylogenetically conserved mediator of αSyn-driven changes in Ca2+ homeostasis and cytotoxicity. Expression of αSyn in yeast resulted in elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels and increased cell death, both of which could be inhibited by deletion of PMR1. Accordingly, absence of PMR1 prevented αSyn-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons in nematodes and flies. In addition, αSyn failed to compromise locomotion and survival of flies when PMR1 was absent. In conclusion, the αSyn-driven rise of cytosolic Ca2+ levels is pivotal for its cytotoxicity and requires PMR1.},

Although intrinsically unstructured when free in solution, alphaS adopts a highly helical conformation in association with lipid membranes or membrane mimetic detergent micelles. Two mutations in the alphaS gene have been linked to early onset autosomal dominant hereditary forms of PD, and have been shown to affect the aggregation kinetics of the protein in vitro. We have used high-resolution NMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and limited proteolysis to investigate the effects of these PD-linked mutations on the helical structure adopted by alphaS in the lipid or detergent micelle-bound form. We show that neither the A53T nor the A30P mutation has a significant effect on the structure of the folded protein, although the A30P mutation may cause a minor perturbation in the helical structure around the site of the mutation. The A30P, but not the A53T, mutation also appears to decrease the affinity of the protein for lipid surfaces, possibly by perturbing the nascent helical structure of the free protein. The potential implications of these results for the role of alphaS in PD are discussed.},

Consistent with a presumed role in neurotransmitter release and its prominent deposition in the dystrophic neurites of PD, alpha-synuclein localizes almost exclusively to the nerve terminal. In brain extracts, however, alpha-synuclein behaves as a soluble, monomeric protein. Using a binding assay to characterize the association of alpha-synuclein with cell membranes, we find that alpha-synuclein binds saturably and with high affinity to characteristic intracellular structures that double label for components of lipid rafts. Biochemical analysis demonstrates the interaction of alpha-synuclein with detergent-resistant membranes and reveals a shift in electrophoretic mobility of the raft-associated protein. In addition, the A30P mutation associated with PD disrupts the interaction of alpha-synuclein with lipid rafts. Furthermore, we find that both the A30P mutation and raft disruption redistribute alpha-synuclein away from synapses, indicating an important role for raft association in the normal function of alpha-synuclein and its role in the pathogenesis of PD.},

	abstract = {SNCA (α-synuclein) misfolding and aggregation is strongly associated with both idiopathic and familial forms of Parkinson disease (PD). Evidence suggests that SNCA has an impact on cell clearance routes and protein quality control systems such as the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy. Recent advances in the key role of the autosomal recessive PARK2/PARKIN and PINK1 genes in mitophagy, highlighted this process as a prominent new pathogenic mechanism. Nevertheless, the role of autophagy/mitophagy in the pathogenesis of sporadic and autosomal dominant familial forms of PD is still enigmatic. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a powerful “empty room” model that has been exploited to clarify different molecular aspects associated with SNCA toxicity, which combines the advantage of being an established system for aging research. The contribution of autophagy/mitophagy for the toxicity induced by the heterologous expression of the human wild-type SNCA gene and the clinical A53T mutant during yeast chronological life span (CLS) was explored. A reduced CLS together with an increase of autophagy and mitophagy activities were observed in cells expressing both forms of SNCA. Impairment of mitophagy by deletion of ATG11 or ATG32 resulted in a CLS extension, further implicating mitophagy in the SNCA toxicity. Deletion of SIR2, essential for SNCA toxicity, abolished autophagy and mitophagy, thereby rescuing cells. These data show that Sir2 functions as a regulator of autophagy, like its mammalian homolog, SIRT1, but also of mitophagy. Our work highlights that increased mitophagy activity, mediated by the regulation of ATG32 by Sir2, is an important phenomenon linked to SNCA-induced toxicity during aging.},

Nonetheless, the precise mechanisms explaining this pathogenic neuronal cell death remain elusive. Endonuclease G (EndoG) is a mitochondrially localized nuclease that triggers DNA degradation and cell death upon translocation from mitochondria to the nucleus. Here, we show that EndoG displays cytotoxic nuclear localization in dopaminergic neurons of human Parkinson-diseased patients, while EndoG depletion largely reduces α-synuclein-induced cell death in human neuroblastoma cells. Xenogenic expression of human α-synuclein in yeast cells triggers mitochondria-nuclear translocation of EndoG and EndoG-mediated DNA degradation through a mechanism that requires a functional kynurenine pathway and the permeability transition pore. In nematodes and flies, EndoG is essential for the α-synuclein-driven degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, the locomotion and survival of α-synuclein-expressing flies is compromised, but reinstalled by parallel depletion of EndoG. In sum, we unravel a phylogenetically conserved pathway that involves EndoG as a critical downstream executor of α-synuclein cytotoxicity., The mitochondrial pro-apoptotic nuclease Endonuclease G is a key downstream executor of α-synuclein neurotoxicity in different Parkinson's disease models.},

These intracellular protein inclusions are primarily composed of misfolded α-synuclein (aSyn), which has also been genetically linked to familial and sporadic forms of PD. DJ-1 is a small ubiquitously expressed protein implicated in several pathways associated with PD pathogenesis. Although mutations in the gene encoding DJ-1 lead to familial early-onset PD, the exact mechanisms responsible for its role in PD pathogenesis are still elusive. Previous work has found that DJ-1--which has protein chaperone-like activity--modulates aSyn aggregation. Here, we investigated possible physical interactions between aSyn and DJ-1 and any consequent functional and pathological relevance. We found that DJ-1 interacts directly with aSyn monomers and oligomers in vitro, and that this also occurs in living cells. Notably, several PD-causing mutations in DJ-1 constrain this interaction. In addition, we found that overexpression of DJ-1 reduces aSyn dimerization, whereas mutant forms of DJ-1 impair this process. Finally, we found that human DJ-1 as well as yeast orthologs of DJ-1 reversed aSyn-dependent cellular toxicity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Taken together, these data suggest that direct interactions between DJ-1 and aSyn constitute the basis for a neuroprotective mechanism and that familial mutations in DJ-1 may contribute to PD by disrupting these interactions.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Identification and replication of susceptibility genes for Parkinson disease at the population level have been hampered by small studies with potential biases. Alpha-synuclein (SNCA) has been one of the most promising susceptibility genes, but large-scale studies have been lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether allele-length variability in the dinucleotide repeat sequence (REP1) of the SNCA gene promoter is associated with Parkinson disease susceptibility, whether SNCA promoter haplotypes are associated with Parkinson disease, and whether REP1 variability modifies age at onset.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We performed a collaborative analysis of individual-level data on SNCA REP1 and flanking markers in patients with Parkinson disease and controls. Study site recruitment, data collection, and analyses were performed between April 5, 2004, and December 31, 2005. Eighteen participating sites of a global genetics consortium provided clinical data. Genotyping was performed for SNCA REP1, -770, and -116 markers at individual sites; however, each site also provided 20 DNA samples for regenotyping centrally.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures included estimations of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls; a test of heterogeneity; analyses for association of single variants or haplotypes; and survival analyses for age at onset.
RESULTS: Of the 18 sites, 11 met stringent criteria for concordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and low genotyping error rate. These 11 sites provided complete data for 2692 cases and 2652 controls. There was no heterogeneity across studies (P{\textgreater}.60). The SNCA REP1 alleles differed in frequency for cases and controls (P{\textless}.001). Genotypes defined by the 263 base-pair allele were associated with Parkinson disease (odds ratio, 1.43; 95\% confidence interval, 1.22-1.69; P{\textless}.001 for trend). Multilocus haplotypes differed in frequency for cases and controls (global score statistic, P{\textless}.001). Two-loci haplotypes were associated with Parkinson disease only when they included REP1 as one of the loci. However, genotypes defined by REP1 alleles did not modify age at onset (P = .55).
CONCLUSION: This large-scale collaborative analysis demonstrates that SNCA REP1 allele-length variability is associated with an increased risk of Parkinson disease.},

	abstract = {alpha-Synuclein has been implicated in the pathophysiology of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease. Mutations in alpha-synuclein cause some cases of familial PD (Polymeropoulos et al., 1997; Kruger et al., 1998). In addition, many neurodegenerative diseases show accumulation of alpha-synuclein in dystrophic neurites and in Lewy bodies (Spillantini et al., 1998). Here, we show that alpha-synuclein shares physical and functional homology with 14-3-3 proteins, which are a family of ubiquitous cytoplasmic chaperones. Regions of alpha-synuclein and 14-3-3 proteins share over 40\% homology. In addition, alpha-synuclein binds to 14-3-3 proteins, as well as some proteins known to associate with 14-3-3, including protein kinase C, BAD, and extracellular regulated kinase, but not Raf-1. We also show that overexpression of alpha-synuclein inhibits protein kinase C activity. The association of alpha-synuclein with BAD and inhibition of protein kinase C suggests that increased expression of alpha-synuclein could be harmful. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that overexpression of wild-type alpha-synuclein is toxic, and overexpression of alpha-synuclein containing the A53T or A30P mutations exhibits even greater toxicity. The activity and binding profile of alpha-synuclein suggests that it might act as a protein chaperone and that accumulation of alpha-synuclein could contribute to cell death in neurodegenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {Alpha-synuclein and cysteine-string protein-alpha (CSPalpha) are abundant synaptic vesicle proteins independently linked to neurodegeneration. Dominantly inherited mutations in alpha-synuclein cause Parkinson's disease, but the physiological role of alpha-synuclein remains unknown. Deletion of CSPalpha produces rapidly progressive neurodegeneration in mice, presumably because the cochaperone function of CSPalpha is essential for neuronal survival. Here, we report the surprising finding that transgenic expression of alpha-synuclein abolishes the lethality and neurodegeneration caused by deletion of CSPalpha. Conversely, ablation of endogenous synucleins exacerbates these phenotypes. Deletion of CSPalpha inhibits SNARE complex assembly; transgenic alpha-synuclein ameliorates this inhibition. In preventing neurodegeneration in CSPalpha-deficient mice, alpha-synuclein does not simply substitute for CSPalpha but acts by a downstream mechanism that requires phospholipid binding by alpha-synuclein. These observations reveal a powerful in vivo activity of alpha-synuclein in protecting nerve terminals against injury and suggest that this activity operates in conjunction with CSPalpha and SNARE proteins on the presynaptic membrane interface.},

	abstract = {Amyloid-like fibrillar aggregates of intracellular proteins are common pathological features of human neurodegenerative diseases. However, the nature of pathogenic aggregates and the biological consequences of their formation remain elusive. Here, we describe (i) a model cellular system in which prefibrillar alpha-synuclein aggregates and fibrillar inclusions are naturally formed in the cytoplasm with distinctive kinetics and (ii) a tight correlation between the presence of prefibrillar aggregates and the Golgi fragmentation. Consistent with the structural abnormality of Golgi apparatus, trafficking and maturation of dopamine transporter through the biosynthetic pathway were impaired in the presence of alpha-synuclein aggregates. Reduction in cell viability was also observed in the prefibrillar aggregate-forming condition and before the inclusion formation. The fibrillar inclusions, on the other hand, showed no correlation with Golgi fragmentation and were preceded by these events. Furthermore, at the early stage of inclusion formation, active lysosomes and mitochondria were enriched in the juxtanuclear area and co-aggregate into a compact inclusion body, suggesting that the fibrillar inclusions might be the consequence of an attempt of the cell to remove abnormal protein aggregates and damaged organelles. These results support the hypothesis that prefibrillar alpha-synuclein aggregates are the pathogenic species and suggest that Golgi fragmentation and subsequent trafficking impairment are the specific consequence of alpha-synuclein aggregation.},

Whether similar inhibition in mammals represents a cause of familial Parkinson's disease has not been established. We tested elements of this hypothesis by expressing human alpha-synuclein in mammalian kidney and neuroendocrine cells and assessing ER-to-Golgi transport. Overexpression of wild type or the familial disease-associated A53T mutant alpha-synuclein delayed transport by up to 50\%; however, A53T inhibited more potently. The secretory delay occurred at low expression levels and was not accompanied by insoluble alpha-synuclein aggregates or mistargeting of transport machinery, suggesting a direct action of soluble alpha-synuclein on trafficking proteins. Co-overexpression of ER/Golgi arginine soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (R-SNAREs) specifically rescued transport, indicating that alpha-synuclein antagonizes SNARE function. Ykt6 reversed alpha-synuclein inhibition much more effectively than sec22b, suggesting a possible neuroprotective role for the enigmatic high expression of ykt6 in neurons. In in vitro reconstitutions, purified alpha-synuclein A53T protein specifically inhibited COPII vesicle docking and fusion at a pre-Golgi step. Finally, soluble alpha-synuclein A53T directly bound ER/Golgi SNAREs and inhibited SNARE complex assembly, providing a potential mechanism for toxic effects in the early secretory pathway.},

We have previously shown that only nigral neurons in PD expressing alpha-synuclein inclusions display a loss dopaminergic phenotype. The present study tested the hypothesis that normal aging contributes to this effect. The relative abundance of alpha-synuclein protein within individual nigral neurons was quantified in eighteen normal humans between the age of 18 and 102 and twenty four rhesus monkeys between the age of 2 and 34. Optical densitometry revealed a robust age-related increase in alpha-synuclein protein within individual nigral neurons in both species. This effect was specific for nigral alpha-synuclein as no age-related changes were found in the ventral tegmental area nor were there changes in the nigra for non-pathogenic beta-synuclein. The age-related increases in nigral alpha-synuclein were non-aggregated and strongly associated with age-related decreases in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme for dopamine production. In fact, only cells expressing alpha-synuclein displayed reductions in TH. We hypothesize that age-related increases in alpha-synuclein result in a subthreshold degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine which, in PD, becomes symptomatic due to lysosomal failure resulting in protein misfolding and inclusion formation. We further hypothesize that preventing the age-related accumulation of non-aggregated alpha-synuclein might be a simple and potent therapeutic target for patients with PD.},

In the present study, a complex of alpha-synuclein and vesicular monoamine transporter-2 was identified by GST-Pull Down experiment. In wild-type alpha-synuclein stably transfected SH-SY5Y cell lines, the activity of vesicular monoamine transporter-2 decreased by 31\% as determined by [(3)H] dopamine uptake, and its expression also decreased in both protein and mRNA levels using western and northern blot analysis. Overexpression of wild-type alpha-synuclein did not induce cell death or apoptosis, but significantly enhanced the intracellular reactive oxygen species level as assayed by flow cytometry. These data suggest that Up-regulated alpha-synuclein expression inhibits the activity of vesicular monoamine transporter-2, thereby interrupting dopamine homeostasis and resulting in dopaminergic neuron injury in Parkinson's disease.},

Two missense mutations (A53T and A30P) are linked to rare forms of familial PD. The normal function of αS is unknown, and cultured cell systems that model its modification from soluble monomers to aggregated forms have not been reported. Through a systematic centrifugal fractionation of mesencephalic neuronal cell lines and transgenic mouse brains expressing wild-type or A53T human αS, we observed unusual, previously unrecognized species of αS that migrate well above the 17-kDa monomeric form in denaturing gels. Incubation at 65°C of high-speed cytosols from cells or brains revealed a modified αS species migrating at ≈36 kDa and an extensive higher molecular mass αS-reactive smear. Extraction of the cytosols with chloroform/methanol or with a resin (Lipidex 1000) that binds fatty acids resulted in a similar pattern of higher molecular mass αS forms. On the basis of this effect of delipidation, we reexamined the primary structure of αS and detected a motif at the N and C termini that is homologous to a fatty acid-binding protein signature. In accord, we found that purified human αS binds oleic acid, with an apparent Kd of 12.5 μM. We also observed an enhanced association of A53T αS with microsomal membranes in both mesencephalic cells and transgenic mouse brains. We conclude that αS has biochemical properties and a structural motif that suggest it is a novel member of the fatty acid-binding protein family and may thus transport fatty acids between the aqueous and membrane phospholipid compartments of the neuronal cytoplasm.},

To gain insight into the molecular functions of synucleins, we performed an unbiased proteomic screen and identified synaptic protein changes in αβγ-synuclein knock-out brains. We observed increases in the levels of select membrane curvature sensing/generating proteins. One of the most prominent changes was for the N-BAR protein endophilin A1. Here we demonstrate that the levels of synucleins and endophilin A1 are reciprocally regulated and that they are functionally related. We show that all synucleins can robustly generate membrane curvature similar to endophilins. However, only monomeric but not tetrameric α-synuclein can bend membranes. Further, A30P α-synuclein, a Parkinson disease mutant that disrupts protein folding, is also deficient in this activity. This suggests that synucleins generate membrane curvature through the asymmetric insertion of their N-terminal amphipathic helix. Based on our findings, we propose to include synucleins in the class of amphipathic helix-containing proteins that sense and generate membrane curvature. These results advance our understanding of the physiological function of synucleins.},

Although many forms of neurodegeneration initiate presynaptically, only few pathogenic mechanisms are known, and the functions of presynaptic proteins linked to neurodegeneration, such as α-synuclein, remain unclear. Here, we find that maintenance of continuous presynaptic SNARE-complex assembly required a non-classical chaperone activity mediated by synucleins. Specifically, α-synuclein directly bound to the SNARE-protein synaptobrevin-2/VAMP2, and promoted SNARE-complex assembly. Moreover, triple knockout mice lacking synucleins developed age-dependent neurological impairments, exhibited decreased SNARE-complex assembly, and perished prematurely. Thus, synucleins may function to sustain normal SNARE-complex assembly in a presynaptic terminal during aging.},

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites (Lewy body pathology; LBP) in 139 autopsies from our normal volunteer control group of the University of Kentucky Alzheimer’s Disease Center. All subjects were followed longitudinally and were cognitively normal without any type of movement disorder, neuropsychiatric features, or other CNS findings. Thirty-three out of 139 normal subjects contained LBP in various brain regions. The most common regions involved were the medulla (26\%), amygdala (24\%), pons (20\%), and midbrain (20\%). No mean statistical differences were found between those with and without LBP on any demographic or cognitive variable, Braak stage, or neurofibrillary tangle and neuritic plaque quantitation. The high prevalence of LBP in our elderly, well educated group is not clear although it does not appear to be related to aging or the presence of AD pathology. Overall, our findings support the concept that incidental Lewy body disease most likely represents preclinical or presymptomatic PD, PDD or DLB.},

On the basis of its highly unfolded and flexible conformation, we have investigated the chaperone-like activity of alpha-synuclein in vitro. In our experiments, alpha-synuclein inhibited the aggregation of model substrates and protected the catalytic activity of alcohol dehydrogenase and rhodanese during heat stress. In addition, alpha-synuclein inhibited the initial aggregation of reduced/denatured lysozyme on the refolding pathway. Interestingly, deletion of the C-terminal regions led to the abolishment of chaperone activity, although largely unstructured conformations are maintained. Moreover, alpha-synuclein could inhibit the aggregation of various Escherichia coli cellular proteins during heat stress, and C-terminal deletion mutants could not provide any protection to these cellular proteins. Results with synthetic C-terminal peptides and C-terminal deletion mutants suggest that the second acidic repeat, (125)YEMPSEEGYQDYEPEA(140), is important for the chaperone activity of alpha-synuclein, and C-terminal deletion leads to the facilitated aggregation with the elimination of chaperone activity.},
